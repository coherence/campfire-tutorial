Campfire is a tutorial project for coherence, a Unity networking framework.  
It is a slightly advanced demo, so if you are new to coherence, we recommend starting from the [First Steps](https://docs.coherence.io/learning-coherence/first-steps-tutorial) tutorial project.

The Campfire project explores these topics:

- Object pooling
- Interacting with remote objects
- Creating a unique object
- Syncing complex states
- Custom instantiation and destruction
- Server-side NPCs (Simulators)
- Playing audio and particles over the network
- Creating a simple chat feature

### Unity version
Currently the project is on Unity `2022.3.5f1`.

## Additional resources

### Documentation
After downloading this Unity project, we suggest to open up the [documentation](https://docs.coherence.io/getting-started/samples-and-tutorials/campfire-project) as it's the perfect companion to explore the topics above.

### Trying a pre-made build
To quickly try a pre-built version of the game, head to [this link](https://coherence.io/games/coherence/campfire-tutorial) and either play the WebGL build in the browser, or download one of the available desktop versions.

## Bug reporting
